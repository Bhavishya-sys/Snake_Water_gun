The Snake, Water, Gun Game is a fun and simple Python project inspired by the classic “Rock, Paper, Scissors” game.
In this version:

🐍 Snake drinks Water

💧 Water douses Gun

🔫 Gun shoots Snake

The player plays against the computer, which makes a random choice every round.

🧠 How It Works

1. The computer randomly selects one option — Snake (s), Water (w), or Gun (g).

2. The player also chooses one of these options.

3. The program compares both choices and declares the result — Win, Lose, or Draw.
